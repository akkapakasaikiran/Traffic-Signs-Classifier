# Traffic Signs Classifier
A Deep Convolutional Neural Network classifier for traffic signs based on Inception modules and Spatial Transformation Networks.

This project was done on Kaggle so you can find the same notebook at https://www.kaggle.com/saikiranakkapaka/traffic-signs-classifier-using-stn-and-inception. It will be executable there. You can even fork it and borrow ideas or code.
